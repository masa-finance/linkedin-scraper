## Error Handling

The example demonstrates proper error handling:

- **Configuration errors**: Missing environment variables
- **Authentication errors**: Invalid credentials or expired tokens
- **API errors**: Rate limiting, server errors, network issues
- **Parsing errors**: Malformed responses or unexpected data structures

## Rate Limiting

The example includes respectful rate limiting:

- **1-second delays** between profile fetching requests
- **Timeout handling** with 30-second context timeout
- **Error backoff** for failed requests

## Best Practices

1. **Set environment variables** for credentials (never hardcode)
2. **Use timeouts** for all API requests
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with proper logging
4. **Respect rate limits** with delays between requests
5. **Export data** for offline analysis when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your LinkedIn cookies are current
   - Check that all required environment variables are set

2. **Profile Not Found**
   - Ensure the public identifier is correct
   - Check that the profile is publicly accessible

3. **Rate Limited**
   - Increase delays between requests
   - Verify your LinkedIn account is in good standing

4. **Empty Fields**
   - Some fields may be private or not filled in by the user
   - Check the profile manually to verify expected data

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging, modify the example to include debug output:

```go
// Add this before making API calls
log.Printf("Fetching profile: %s", publicIdentifier)
```

## Next Steps

After running this example, you might want to:

1. **Modify the search criteria** to find different types of profiles
2. **Add data persistence** to save profiles to a database
3. **Create batch processing** to handle large numbers of profiles
4. **Add data analysis** to extract insights from profile data
5. **Build a web interface** to visualize the data
